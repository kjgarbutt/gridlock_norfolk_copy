        This basic traffic model explores how agents travel through Norfolk.
        The idea is that if you increased the number of agents
        (people) more congestion will arise. To some extent this is similar to
        the GeoMason sim.app.geo.campusworld example. The model demonstrates how
        you can make agents move along networks (in this case road lines in the
        form of ESRI shapefiles) from their origin to their destination via a
        shortest path algorithm (A*).
